# Twilio Onboarding Project

## Project Introduction

This project is a Node.js web application utilizing Twilio APIs to demonstrate communication capabilities such as sending messages and making calls. It's designed to help developers understand and implement Twilio-based solutions in their applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you need the following installed:
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- A Twilio account with appropriate API keys

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd twilio-onboarding
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd app
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure your environment variables:
   - Copy `sample.env` to `.env`:
     ```bash
     cp sample.env .env
     ```
   - Fill in the necessary details in `.env` based on your Twilio account settings.

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command in the `app` directory:
```bash
npm start
```
This will launch the server on `localhost` with the default configured port (usually 3000), allowing you to access the application through your web browser.

## File Structure

| File/Directory       | Description                                           |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `index.js`           | Main entry point for the application. Initializes the server and imports routes. |
| `routes.js`          | Contains routing logic for the application. Defines endpoints and associated handlers. |
| `endpoint-methods/`  | Directory containing specific methods for handling requests at different endpoints. |
| `twilio-helper/`     | Helper functions and utilities for interacting with Twilio APIs. |
| `package.json`       | Lists project dependencies and metadata.              |
| `package-lock.json`  | Locks down the versions of installed npm packages.    |
| `.env` / `sample.env`| Environment configuration files. `.env` is for production, and `sample.env` serves as a template. |
| `node_modules/`      | Contains npm packages installed for the project.     |

## Detailed Code Explanation

### `index.js`
This file serves as the entry point of the application. It sets up the Express server and imports all routes from `routes.js`. Here, you'll also find middleware configurations and the server's listen function.

### `routes.js`
Handles the routing of the application. It imports various methods from `endpoint-methods` and assigns them to specific routes. This file is crucial for directing incoming requests to the correct handlers.

### `endpoint-methods/`
This directory includes various JavaScript files, each corresponding to a different set of functionalities or API endpoint interactions. These methods are used by `routes.js` to handle specific tasks like sending SMS, making calls, etc.

### `twilio-helper/`
Contains utility functions and configurations specifically tailored for Twilio API interaction. This includes initializing the Twilio client and creating functions that facilitate sending SMS or making calls.
